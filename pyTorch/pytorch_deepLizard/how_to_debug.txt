How To Debug
In order to debug any python code in Visual Studio Code, we need to install the python debugging extension. This will give us debugging capabilities. Once the debugging extension is installed, we follow these steps.

Place a breakpoint
Run the program in debug mode
Use Keyboard to manually control program execution
Step into something PyTorch
Note that there is an additional requirement to debug imported libraries like PyTorch. We need to set the justMyCode attribute to false inside the launch.json file for VS Code.

Below is an example launch configuration.

{
    "name": "Python: Current File",
    "type": "python",
    "request": "launch",
    "program": "${file}",
    "justMyCode": false,
    "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
}
